Build:
Solution created and tested on MacOS Macbook with M1 apple silicon but should work everywhere.
Simple make file created. To build project just type make in console in root folder. After run executable with ./myapp.
It just simpliest solution, that created with basic networking primitives. I tryied to apply SOLID principles when writing this application.
There are lot area of improvement, it can be rewrited without classes or even in C lang to work faster and better. Or we can change direction
and rewrite everything using boost::asio and create a lot of new functionality.
